Go to `http://localhost:10002` and have fun playing checkers.

## Rules
* white makes the first move
* it is played on a 8x8 board
* men can capture only forward
* capturing is mandatory
* kings can also move (and capture) backwards
* a player without pieces remaining or who cannot move due to blocked pieces loses the game
* no flying kings
